List any changes that should be made to get stuff working:
- for MovieRedBlackTree.java
	- things are returning null when items are not found; these cause NullPointerExceptions in Backend
	(instead, just return empty lists)
- for frontend:
	- when returning search results, have all information for the movies display on console
