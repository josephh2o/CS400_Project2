List any changes that should be made to get stuff working:
- for MovieRedBlackTree.java
	- things are returning null when items are not found; these cause NullPointerExceptions in Backend
	(instead, just return empty lists)
	- getting a never ending loop around "man with the golden gun"
- for frontend:
	- when returning search results, have all information for the movies display on console
	- we should address situations where the user calls functions before the data loads
- backend or algo
    - there are duplicates so the current technique of having each movie be it's own list isn't working
    but also, what if we just deleted the duplicates?
